# Simple Chat Using Node Js and Socket.io


The very first step to install and test this chat is get the repository into our local machine

```

  git clone https://github.com/Keenyy1997/hello-world

```

After clone the repository, we need to install the dependencies

```
  npm install
```

And the last step is simply run the project :D

```
  npm start
```

And thats everything you need to set up an simple **node js** chat using **socket.io**
